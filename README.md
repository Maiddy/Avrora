# That is Avrora engine ~~yeeeeee~~.

This engine provides to you on 01.20.23 only UI and some other features.
But in future(I think by the beginning of March of 2023)
here will be many features to manage most stuff.

## Is it usable?

**Yes, it is**

For most text-based games you need only nice print and easy way to
manipulate with game's objects(I think so), but do not forget about cool story.
So, it is provides it to you.
See [documentation](documentation.md) ~~and make sure it is slag~~.
